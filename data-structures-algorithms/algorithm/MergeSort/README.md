Merge Sort works by recursively dividing the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element. Then, these subarrays are merged back together in a sorted order. The merging process is what makes Merge Sort powerfulâ€”it efficiently combines the sorted subarrays back into a complete sorted array

The Merge Sort algorithm can be broken down into three main steps: Divide, Conquer, and Merge

1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the two halves to produce the sorted array.
