    "### Phases of Catalyst Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analysis Phase**\n",
    "   - **Description**: This phase resolves references to columns, tables, and functions, and checks for errors in the query. It converts the parsed logical plan into a resolved logical plan.\n",
    "   - **Key Tasks**:\n",
    "     - Resolving column names and table references.\n",
    "     - Validating function calls and expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logical Optimization Phase**\n",
    "   - **Description**: During this phase, rule-based optimizations are applied to the logical plan. These optimizations are deterministic and aim to simplify and improve the logical plan.\n",
    "   - **Rule-Based Optimizations**:\n",
    "     - **Constant Folding**: Simplifies expressions with constant values at compile time.\n",
    "     - **Predicate Pushdown**: Moves filters closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed.\n",
    "     - **Projection Pruning**: Removes unnecessary columns from the query plan.\n",
    "     - **Null Propagation**: Simplifies expressions involving null values.\n",
    "     - **Boolean Expression Simplification**: Simplifies complex boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Physical Planning Phase**\n",
    "   - **Description**: In this phase, the optimizer generates multiple physical plans from the optimized logical plan and selects the most efficient one based on cost.\n",
    "   - **Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)**:\n",
    "     - **Statistics Collection**: Gathering data statistics such as row counts, column cardinality, and data distribution.\n",
    "     - **Plan Generation**: Creating different physical plans with various join orders, join types, and execution strategies.\n",
    "     - **Cost Estimation**: Calculating the cost of each plan based on the collected statistics.\n",
    "     - **Plan Selection**: Choosing the plan with the lowest estimated cost for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Generation Phase**\n",
    "   - **Description**: This phase involves generating Java bytecode to execute parts of the query. This leverages runtime code generation for better performance.\n",
    "   - **Key Tasks**:\n",
    "     - Generating efficient bytecode for expressions and operations.\n",
    "     - Ensuring that the generated code can be executed efficiently by the Spark engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Interview Questions\n",

    "   - How does predicate pushdown improve query performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost-Based Optimization**:\n",
    "   - How does cost-based optimization differ from rule-based optimization in Spark?\n",
    "   - What steps are involved in the cost-based optimization process during the physical planning phase?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specific Techniques**:\n",
    "   - Can you explain how constant folding works in the Catalyst optimizer?\n",
